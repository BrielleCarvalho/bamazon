#This web application tracks a table of products, their department name, stock quantity, and price. I've created the table in a database using MySQL Workbench. 

#The customer view allows you to "purchase" a product, changes the amount in stock, and provides total cost.

#It also shows you an "Insufficient Quantity!" warning if we don't have enough stock to complete your order.

##This web application tracks a table of products, their department name, stock quantity, and price. I've created the table in a database using MySQL Workbench. 

##The customer view allows you to "purchase" a product and changes the amount in stock.

##The manager view allows to look at all products, look at low inventory products, change the inventory of a product, or add an entirely new product.
